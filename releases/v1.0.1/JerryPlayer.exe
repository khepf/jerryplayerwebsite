This is a placeholder for the actual JerryPlayer.exe file.
In a real deployment, this would be the compiled executable from your main project.

To test the download functionality:
1. Replace this file with the actual JerryPlayer.exe
2. The download.php script will serve this file when the download button is clicked
3. The download will be logged to downloads.log

File Size: This placeholder is much smaller than the actual ~15MB executable
Platform: Windows 10+
Requirements: .NET 8
