## Usage Instructions

### For Users (Website Visitors)
1. Visit the website
2. Navigate to the download section
3. Choose between:
   - **Download JerryPlayer.exe**: Direct executable file
   - **Download JerryPlayer.zip**: ZIP archive with additional files

### For Developers/Administrators

#### Adding a New Release
1. Build the JerryPlayer.exe from the main project
2. Run the release script:
   ```cmd
   update-release.bat v1.0.2
   ```
3. Update the version number in `src/components/DownloadSection.jsx`
4. Build and deploy the website

#### Manual Release Process
1. Create a new version directory: `releases/v1.0.2/`
2. Copy `JerryPlayer.exe` to the version directory
3. Create `JerryPlayer.zip` containing the executable and documentation
4. Update the `releases/latest/` directory with the new files
5. Update the website's version information

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test both download buttons
3. Verify the download.php script works correctly
4. Check that downloads are logged properly

### Production Testing
1. Deploy the website to your web server
2. Upload the releases folder and download.php script
3. Test downloads from the live website
4. Monitor the downloads.log file

## Security Considerations

- The download.php script validates file types and names
- Only allowed file types can be downloaded
- All downloads are logged with IP addresses and timestamps
- Consider adding rate limiting for production use

## Future Enhancements

- Add download statistics/analytics
- Implement automatic version checking
- Add digital signature verification for downloads
- Create checksums for integrity verification
- Add download mirrors for better availability

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the downloads.log file for error messages
2. Verify file permissions on the releases directory
3. Ensure PHP is properly configured on your server
4. Test the download.php script directly with query parameters
